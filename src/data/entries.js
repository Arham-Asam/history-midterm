        title: `Arabia Before Islam`,
        content: `The Arabian Peninsula in the 5th and 6th centuries CE was on a surface level an insignificant region, 
            with a harsh inhospitable geography typical of a desert region. Inhabited by a variety of independent tribes,
            the region had little influence or significance in the area, especially when contrasted with the neighboring Byzantine and 
            Sasanian Empires. 
            
            The Arabs before Islam were a brutish, ignorant and cruel people, most of them were illiterate 
            and did not value education or intellectualism at all. They constantly engages in tribal conflict, often over 
            menial issues, and committed infanticide, particularly of female babies, as the position of women in Arab societies was
            extremely poor.¹

        title: `The Emergence Of Islam`,
        content: `Islam is a monotheistic faith with similarities to Judaism and Christianity, in in some sense a continuation of these faiths. 
        The exact details behind the emergence of Islam are difficult to ascertain, as much of the sources of information of early Muslims 
        comes from oral transmission including religious sources, and due to widespread illiteracy few external writings exist.

        Islam's core value is the worship of one God, Allah, and the leadership and message of the prophets, including the last and most
        important Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Muslims believe Allah to be the one true God, but Allah is not separate from the God of Judaism and 
        Christianity. Although Islam as it is known today emerged in the 7th century CE, Muslims believe that the message of Islam is here
        as a reminder, to revise the changes made to Judaism and Christianity which according to Islamic tradition make the religions no longer
        true to their original message.
        
        Mecca was and still is the most significant city during the emergence of Islam. Mecca's existence relied on trade routes 
        to western Arabia which linked it to the productive region of Syria.¹  Mecca was also the home of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH),
        and according to Islamic tradition the place where Abraham and Ishmael built the Kaaba, the most important Islamic site for 
        Muslims. The Prophet (PBUH) restored the Kaaba to be a place of worship of Allah as Islam was being spread, and the polytheists
        were defeated in various conflicts.`,

        title: `The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)`,
        content: `The Prophet Muhammad was born outside Mecca and was a merchant from the powerful Arab tribe called the Quraysh. 
        The Quraysh were powerful and influential, as they were caretakers of the Kaaba, which was an important polytheist house of idol worship.
        The Kaaba was considered to be a neutral zone, which allowed the free passage of luxury goods which would otherwise be under risk of bandit 
        attacks. According to Islamic belief, Muhammad received the first revelation from God conveyed by Gabriel in the year 610. 
        He gave up his lucrative business as a merchant to spread the message of monotheism he received from God, and began to preach to the Arabs.
        His wife Khadija was the first person to convert to Islam, and was a strong supporter of the Prophet throughout her life. 
        
        In the year 622 the Propher fled Mecca due to persecution by the polytheists, and made pilgrimage to Medina where he was welcomed by 
        the people. This 'Hijra', or emmigration, was a very important event for the preservation of Islam, which was at risk of collapsing due
        to the persecution of the Meccans. 
        
        Muhammad's community, the community of Muslims, was known (and is still known) as the Ummah. Muhammad worked with the Jews and peaceful
        polytheists in Medina to establish peace through the Constitution of Medina. This was a catalyst to the expansion of Islam, as after 
        a few conflicts including the Battle of Badr¹, in 630 the tribe of Quraysh surrendered, and the city of Mecca converted to Islam.
        The idols in the Kaaba were destroyed, reminiscent of the  story of the both Islamic and Biblical Prophet Abraham, and the house of Allah
        was restored. Muhammad succeeded in the unification of the Arabs through his preaching and guidance from Islam.`,
