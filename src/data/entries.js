        content: `The Arabian Peninsula in the 5th and 6th centuries CE was on a surface level an insignificant region, 
            with a harsh inhospitable geography typical of a desert region. Inhabited by a variety of independent tribes,
            the region had little influence or significance in the area, especially when contrasted with the neighboring Byzantine and 
            Sasanian Empires. The Arabs before Islam were a brutish, ignorant and cruel people, most of them were illiterate 
            and did not value education or intellectualism at all. They constantly engages in tribal conflict, often over 
            menial issues, and committed infanticide, particularly of female babies, as the position of women in Arab societies was
            extremely poor.¹
