b:T741,The Prophet Muhammad was born outside Mecca and was a merchant from the powerful Arab tribe called the Quraysh. 
        The Quraysh were powerful and influential, as they were caretakers of the Kaaba, which was an important polytheist house of idol worship.
        The Kaaba was considered to be a neutral zone, which allowed the free passage of luxury goods which would otherwise be under risk of bandit 
        attacks. According to Islamic belief, Muhammad received the first revelation from God conveyed by Gabriel in the year 610. 
        He gave up his lucrative business as a merchant to spread the message of monotheism he received from God, and began to preach to the Arabs.
        His wife Khadija was the first person to convert to Islam, and was a strong supporter of the Prophet throughout her life. 
        
        In the year 622 the Propher fled Mecca due to persecution by the polytheists, and made pilgrimage to Medina where he was welcomed by 
        the people. This 'Hijra', or emmigration, was a very important event for the preservation of Islam, which was at risk of collapsing due
        to the persecution of the Meccans. 
        
        Muhammad's community, the community of Muslims, was known (and is still known) as the Ummah. Muhammad worked with the Jews and peaceful
        polytheists in Medina to establish peace through the Constitution of Medina. This was a catalyst to the expansion of Islam, as after 
        a few conflicts including the Battle of Badr¹, in 630 the tribe of Quraysh surrendered, and the city of Mecca converted to Islam.
        The idols in the Kaaba were destroyed, reminiscent of the  story of the both Islamic and Biblical Prophet Abraham, and the house of Allah
        was restored. Muhammad succeeded in the unification of the Arabs through his preaching and guidance from Islam.0:{"P":null,"b":"WphkgxJXP2Fm1koJoGQXf","p":"/history-midterm","c":["","entries","3"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["entries",{"children":[["id","3","d"],{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/history-midterm/_next/static/css/ad27c676daf4b70e.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","$L3",null,{"maxWidth":"md","sx":{"mt":4},"children":["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]]}]}]]}],{"children":["entries",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["id","3","d"],["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L6",null,{"sx":{"mt":5},"children":["$","$L7",null,{"children":[["$","$L8",null,{"component":"img","height":"300","image":"/images/quba.jpg","alt":"The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)"}],["$","$L9",null,{"children":[["$","$La",null,{"variant":"h4","gutterBottom":true,"children":"The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)"}],["$","$La",null,{"variant":"body1","sx":{"whiteSpace":"pre-line"},"children":"$b"}],["$","$La",null,{"variant":"body2","sx":{"mt":3,"fontStyle":"italic","color":"gray"},"children":"SIDDIQI, ASLAM. “JIHĀD, AN INSTRUMENT OF ISLAMIC REVOLUTION.” Islamic Studies 2, no. 3 (1963): 383–98. http://www.jstor.org/stable/20832700."}],""]}]]}]}],"$undefined",null,["$","$Lc",null,{"children":["$Ld","$Le",null]}]]}],{},null,false]},null,false]},null,false]},null,false],["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$1","rU7cTTxDEPwbMdNya7doC",{"children":[["$","$Lf",null,{"children":"$L10"}],null]}],["$","$L11",null,{"children":"$L12"}]]}],false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$13","$undefined"],"s":false,"S":true}
